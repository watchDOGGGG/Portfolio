export const about_me = `
Hello! My name is Prince Emmanuel (Randy) and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in mobile development started back in 2014 when I decided to try hackimg stuff on the internet got an advise that before i can hack or break anything i have to learn how its been built!, 
this process lead me to start building innovative stuff and instead of breaking things i learnt to make them stronger.
Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design community. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.
I also recently launched a social network that allows radio broadcasting system between radio stations and users on the site using React, Howler.js, NodeJs, Sockek.io icecast and more.
